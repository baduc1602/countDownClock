# countDownClock
Put the music file and clock.py in the same file. 
<br>
Then run the clock.py
<br>
You can click on the minus or plus button to set the time (minutes:seconds) and the left "+", "-" buttons change the minutes, the right one change the seconds. 
<br> 
After you finish setting the time, you can click on "START" to run. When time's up it will play a song. You can click anywhere to stop the music.
<br> Additionally, I have the "RESET" button to set the time to 0h0s.
